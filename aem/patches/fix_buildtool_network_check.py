"""Force buildtool's Procedure._check_network to the retry-based implementation.

The apollo-neo-buildtool package installs a single-attempt _check_network
(one curl call, 5s timeout, no retry), so any transient network hiccup
flips buildtool into permanent offline mode for the rest of the run. We
want the retry version below instead (7 attempts, 15s timeout each).

This replaces the whole method body unconditionally (matched by its
`def _check_network(self):` header up to the next method at the same
indentation), regardless of exactly how the currently installed body is
written. Re-applied on every container (re)creation because
`apt install --only-upgrade` reinstalls the single-attempt version every
time. Safe to run repeatedly (idempotent).
